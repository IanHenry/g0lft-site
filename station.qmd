# Station

I operate HF, VHF, and UHF using a mixture of fixed, mobile, and portable equipment, with a particular focus on digital modes and SDR-based systems.

My current setup includes:

- HF base and portable operation (including POTA)
- VHF/UHF FM and digital voice
- Homebrew and commercial SDR receivers
- Raspberry Pi–based digital voice infrastructure

I periodically update this page as my setup evolves.
