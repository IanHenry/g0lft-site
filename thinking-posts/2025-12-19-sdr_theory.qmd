## Introduction

Software-defined radios (SDRs) are not just tools for communication—they are powerful platforms for teaching the underlying theory of radio systems.  

### Benefits for Learning

- Immediate feedback: you can see signals in real time.  
- Experimentation: easily test modulation, filters, and antennas.  
- Visualization: spectrum displays make abstract concepts tangible.  

### Conclusion

Treating SDRs as learning spaces allows students to connect theory to practice quickly and safely.
