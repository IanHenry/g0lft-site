# Seeing an FM Repeater in IQ Space

In the previous post we looked at broadcast FM, where a strong, continuous carrier produces a clean and steady pattern in IQ space. In this post, we’ll look at a narrowband FM repeater signal and see how the same underlying geometry appears in a much more dynamic, real-world setting.

The capture shown here is from the **GB3PI** repeater, and includes silence, background noise, the repeater keying up, a spoken time announcement, and the carrier dropping again. Nothing about the modulation itself has changed, but the behaviour in IQ space becomes far richer.

## A reminder: FM geometry still applies

Before looking at the plots, it’s worth restating the key point from the previous post:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key point
In FM, information is carried in frequency deviation, not amplitude.
:::

That remains true here. The differences we’ll see arise from:

- The carrier turning on and off  
- Periods of silence  
- Noise being passed by the receiver  
- Speech appearing intermittently  

## IQ constellation over the full capture

<details>
<summary>Load IQ and plot full-segment constellation</summary>

```python
iq, fs, fc = load_iq("iq_capture.npz")

iq = iq[1000:]  # drop initial transient
N = min(len(iq), 80000000)
iq_seg = iq[:N]

plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
plt.scatter(iq_seg.real, iq_seg.imag, s=2, alpha=0.3)
plt.xlabel("I")
plt.ylabel("Q")
plt.title(f"Constellation @ {fc/1e6:.3f} MHz")
plt.axis("equal")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
</details>

When all IQ samples from the capture are plotted together, the result is less tidy than the broadcast FM case. Instead of a single clean circle, we see a dense central cluster with a surrounding ring.

This immediately tells us something important:

- The repeater is not transmitting continuously
- Large portions of the capture contain only noise
- The central cloud corresponds to periods when the repeater is idle. 

With no strong carrier present, the IQ samples collapse toward the origin and form a roughly circular noise distribution.

The ring corresponds to periods when the repeater is active and transmitting FM.

## Dynamic IQ: silence, key-up, speech

<details> 
<summary>Animated IQ (GIF, no audio)</summary>
```python
# GIF-only animation derived from full animation script
ani.save("dynamic_iq.gif", dpi=80)
```
</details>

}

Animating the IQ samples reveals the structure much more clearly.

The sequence is easy to follow:

- **Silence**: a tight, noisy cloud near the origin
- **Key-up**: a sudden appearance of a rotating ring
- **Speech**: continuous rotation with changing speed
- **Carrier drop**: collapse back into noise

This animation reinforces an important idea:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Observation

The appearance or disappearance of a carrier is immediately visible in IQ space.
:::

No demodulation is required to see when the repeater is active.

## Magnitude vs time: carrier presence
<details> 
<summary>Plot magnitude vs time</summary>
```python
mag = np.abs(iq_seg)
plt.plot(t, mag)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("|IQ|")
plt.show()
```
</details>

![Magnitude of IQ vs Time](images/mag_vs_time.png){
#fig-mag
fig-align="left"
width=100%
}

Plotting magnitude against time shows clear steps corresponding to the repeater turning on and off. When the carrier is present, the magnitude rises sharply and remains roughly constant. When the repeater is idle, the magnitude drops back to the noise floor.

As with broadcast FM, the magnitude does not follow the speech itself. This confirms that amplitude is not being used to carry information, even though amplitude changes are useful for detecting transmission boundaries.

## Phase and instantaneous frequency
### Unwrapped Phase
<details> 
<summary>Unwrapped phase and instantaneous frequency</summary>
```python
phase = np.angle(iq_seg)
phase_unwrapped = np.unwrap(phase)

inst_freq = np.diff(phase_unwrapped) * fs / (2*np.pi)
```
</details>

![Unwrapped phase vs Time](images/unwrapped_phase_vs_time.png){
#fig-phase
fig-align="left"
width=100%
}

When the repeater is idle, the unwrapped phase shows a steady diagonal trend rather than a flat or stable line. This reflects the receiver’s residual frequency offset combined with noise, in the absence of a coherent carrier.

When the repeater transmits, the phase behaviour changes abruptly. The presence of a strong carrier dominates the phase evolution, suppressing the noise-driven drift seen during silence and producing a far more coherent and structured trace.

Rather than revealing modulation directly, the unwrapped phase plot is most useful here as a detector of signal presence. It clearly distinguishes between periods dominated by noise and periods dominated by a real carrier.

This makes phase plots particularly good at distinguishing:

- Carrier present vs absent
- Signal vs noise

### Instantaneous frequency: speech appears

![Instantaneous frequency](images/inst_freq_vs_time.png){
#fig-inst
fig-align="left"
width=100%
}

Plotting instantaneous frequency over the full capture reveals a striking contrast between silence and transmission. During periods with no carrier present, the frequency estimate spans a very wide range. These large excursions do not represent real frequency deviation, but arise from differentiating the phase of wideband noise, where instantaneous frequency is not well defined.

When the repeater is transmitting, the instantaneous frequency collapses into a much narrower band. In this regime the phase evolves smoothly, and frequency deviation becomes meaningful. The spoken time announcement appears clearly as structured deviations around the centre frequency.

Compared to broadcast FM:

- The deviation is narrower
- The audio bandwidth is smaller
- Transitions between silence and speech are more abrupt

This reflects the operational nature of narrowband FM used on repeaters.

### Demodulated audio
<details> 
<summary>FM demodulation using active IQ only</summary>
```python
active_mask = mag > squelch_thresh
iq_active = iq_seg[active_mask]

phase_active = np.unwrap(np.angle(iq_active))
inst_freq_active = np.diff(phase_active) * fs / (2*np.pi)

audio = filtfilt(b, a, inst_freq_active)
audio /= np.max(np.abs(audio))
```
</details>

![Demodulated audio waveform](images/demod_fm_audio_active.png){
#fig-demod
fig-align="left"
width=100%
}

Demodulating the signal using only periods where the carrier is present produces the expected result: silence, followed by the spoken time announcement, and finally noise as the repeater drops.

The recovered audio appears weaker than the wide excursions seen during noise-only periods. This is expected for narrowband FM captured over a wide bandwidth: noise produces large, unstructured phase changes, while speech introduces relatively small frequency deviations.

As before, the demodulated audio is included only as a reference. All of the essential behaviour — carrier presence, silence, speech, and transitions — has already been visible in the IQ-derived plots.

## Audio-synchronised IQ animation
::: {#fig-video fig-cap="Animated IQ plot with audio overlay"}

{{< video images/dynamic_iq_audio.mp4

>}}

:::

Synchronising the IQ animation with the demodulated audio makes the relationship between speech and frequency deviation intuitive. As the announcement plays, the rotation rate varies in step with the spoken words; when the audio stops, the rotation vanishes entirely.

## What the repeater example adds

Compared to broadcast FM, the repeater example highlights three additional ideas:

- Carriers can appear and disappear, and IQ shows this immediately
- Noise collapses toward the origin in the absence of a signal
- Real-world signals are intermittent, even when the modulation is unchanged

The underlying FM geometry is the same, but the operating context adds structure that is easy to see in IQ space.

## Where next

So far, all the signals we’ve looked at have used frequency modulation and contained a clear carrier. In the next post, we’ll switch modulation entirely and look at airband AM, where the carrier remains but the information moves from rotation rate to amplitude, producing a very different picture in IQ space.
