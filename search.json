    "text": "2025 - A Year of Listening:\n\nFinding Structure, Curiosity and Understanding Through Amateur Radio\nAt the beginning of this year, I was completely unaware of amateur radio. I was recovering from illness and work was already proving more challenging than usual. I needed something mentally stimulating but not demanding, something absorbing, technical and quietly constructive.\nIn April, I stumbled upon amateur radio almost by chance. Initially, it wasn’t about licences or operating privileges; it was simply fascinating. Signals emerged from noise, antennas behaved in unexpected ways and the concept of meaningful communication with minimal power captivated me.\nMy curiosity quickly turned into momentum. I sat the Foundation exam in May and shortly afterwards the Intermediate. Looking back, this pace reflects more on circumstance than ability. Radio provided a concrete focus during a time when many other aspects of my life felt fragmented.\nWork remained challenging throughout the year, but studying and operating became a consistent background activity. It kept me engaged, distracted in a positive way and fostered a renewed sense of learning. I experimented extensively with various modes, bands and contact methods, not for the sake of achievements, but to understand how the hobby’s components fit together.\nJoining Cambridge and District Amateur Radio Club (CDARC) was another significant milestone. Interacting with generous individuals who shared their time and experience reminded me that amateur radio is as much about people as it is about equipment or exams. Observing diverse operating styles and problem-solving approaches was as enlightening as any reading I’ve done.\nLater in the year, I decided to work towards the Full licence. I mainly studied from the RSGB book, reading slowly and following ideas rather than memorising answers. I was awarded a distinction, which I mention only because it led to a lasting realisation: the most challenging aspects of learning radio aren’t about formulas or regulations – they’re about visualising what’s actually happening.\nThat’s where books fall short.\nCircuits, filters, impedance, noise and signal flow are inherently dynamic, constantly changing and interacting. Static diagrams and paragraphs can only take you so far before you need to observe behaviour, not just read about it. A capacitor charging, a filter rejecting energy and a weak signal emerging from noise are processes, not pictures.\nAs someone who works professionally with complex systems, I’ve become increasingly convinced that radio education would greatly benefit from improved visual and animated explanations. This isn’t to replace books but to complement them – to transform abstract concepts into something you can watch evolve and intuitively understand.\nThis idea is one of the reasons this blog exists.\nNext year, I want to spend less time acquiring equipment and more time understanding it. If this space becomes anything, I hope it becomes a place where difficult radio concepts are explained visually patiently and honestly – where behaviour is shown, not just described, and where understanding can grow over time.\nAmateur radio didn’t solve a difficult year but it gave it structure – and that proved more valuable than I anticipated.\nIf you’re curious, have questions or want to share your own experiences, feel free to get in touch. I’d love to hear from fellow enthusiasts."

    "text": "About\nI’m Dr Ian Henry. I live in a village just south of Cambridge and am a licensed UK radio amateur.\nI discovered amateur radio by chance in 2025 and progressed through the Foundation, Intermediate, and Full licences within the same year, achieving my Full licence with distinction in December 2025. The pace of that journey reflects what I enjoy most about the hobby: learning, experimentation, and deepening understanding.\nMy interests centre on digital modes, SDR, and the theory that sits behind modern amateur radio practice. I spend a lot of time working with modes such as FT8 and JS8, experimenting with packet radio, and building or configuring SDR-based systems. I’m equally interested in how people learn these technologies and how we explain complex ideas clearly.\nAlongside operating, I’m passionate about teaching, training, and helping others enjoy the hobby — particularly by demystifying the underlying concepts rather than focusing only on procedures or equipment.\nThis site brings together:\n\nreflective writing on amateur radio, teaching, and learning\ntheory-focused pieces on SDR and digital communication\npractical guides for operators who want to understand why things work, not just how\n\nIf you’d like to get in touch, collaborate, or talk radio, you can find contact details in the footer."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nModern software-defined radios (SDRs) do not deliver audio directly. Instead, they provide a stream of complex samples known as I and Q, which together describe the radio signal at baseband. This representation preserves both amplitude and phase, allowing software to examine, demodulate, or decode a wide range of signals long after they have been captured. In this series of posts, I’ll use raw IQ data to look at what familiar radio signals actually look like before demodulation.\nRepresenting a signal as IQ turns the radio waveform into a rotating vector in the complex plane. For signals with a carrier, this rotation is not an error but a fundamental part of the signal’s structure. By plotting these IQ samples directly, we can build visual intuition for how different modulations work — what changes, what stays the same, and where the information really lives.\nThis post is the first in a short series exploring what different radio signals look like in IQ space. It begins with broadcast FM, moves to narrowband FM and then to airband FM. In the future I may add posts around digital modes as IQ plots are especially good at investigating modulation patterns\n\nBroadcast FM in IQ Space\n\nThe simplest case: a single strong carrier\nBroadcast FM is a good place to start because it produces one of the cleanest and most recognisable patterns in IQ space. A broadcast FM signal consists of a strong carrier whose frequency is varied by the audio, while its amplitude remains largely constant. When viewed as IQ samples, this carrier appears as a rotating vector in the complex plane.\nIf the receiver is tuned exactly to the centre frequency, the carrier rotates at a steady rate. Any frequency offset between the transmitter and receiver simply changes how fast this rotation appears.\n\n(Figure 1 : IQ scatter plot, short time window)\nIn Figure 1 When plotting the raw IQ samples of a broadcast FM signal, the result is a near-perfect circle. This is the rotating carrier. Unlike AM, the radius of the circle remains almost constant — the signal does not “breathe” in and out.\nWhat does change is the angular velocity. As the transmitted audio modulates the carrier frequency, the rotation speeds up and slows down. In a static scatter plot this motion is not visible, but in a time-ordered or fading plot it becomes clear that the signal is continuously rotating."
